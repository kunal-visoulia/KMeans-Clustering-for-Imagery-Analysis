# KMeans-Clustering-for-Imagery-Analysis
Use a K-means algorithm to perform image classification

Clustering isn't limited to the consumer information and population sciences, it can be used for imagery analysis as well. Leveraging the MNIST dataset, understanding the use of K-means clustering for computer vision.

In this project,
- Preprocess images for clustering
- Deploy K-means clustering algorithms
- Use common metrics to evaluate cluster performance
- Visualize high-dimensional cluster centroids
