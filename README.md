# KMeans-Clustering-for-Imagery-Analysis
Use a K-means algorithm to perform image classification

## DATASET
Clustering isn't limited to the consumer information and population sciences, it can be used for imagery analysis as well. Leveraging the MNIST dataset(from keras.datasets)

In this project,
- Preprocess images for clustering
- Deploy K-means clustering algorithms
- Use common metrics to evaluate cluster performance
- Visualize high-dimensional cluster centroids
